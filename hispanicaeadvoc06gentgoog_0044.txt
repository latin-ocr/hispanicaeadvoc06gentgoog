the sailors‚ who, in fighting, were not acting under the
instructions of the owners‚ and under the public laws of war
the sailors may not be regarded as pirates.

CHAPTER XXVIII.-Possaqe·money is owed for the Yurks captured
by the Tuscuns on an Enqlisl ship.

Tuscans‚¹ must be paid by the T uscans‚ because “the victor
takes the place of the vanquished‚‘’ and “ claims upon property
go with it when it changes hands.”
