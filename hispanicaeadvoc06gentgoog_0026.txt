CHAPTER 1.-W hother there is postliminium in the domuin of a
common friend.

“The question at issue is whether certain Lusitanians, who
have been taken prisoners by Dutch enemies on the Spanish
sea, become free here in England, by way ol which they were

being taken to Holland.'’ The law bearing on the case reads
‘ that “it is understood that a person is back again from the
moment when he reaches our friend,’' and “ our ‘’ should be
understood as properly used of a friend to both belligerent
parties, i.e., a neutral. If the word were restricted in its
application to a people friendly to one ol the belligerents and
hostile to the other, it would be superfluous, since it would
state a seli-evident truth, whereas law deals with cases in
which doubt may ariae. The historical argument that captive
Romans, sold by Carthaginians in Greece, were not set lree
by Greece is not to the point, because friendly relations between
Rome and Greece had not been set up at the time the
incident in question occurred, and there had been little previous
intercourse between the two countries. It may even be said
that in the particular case ol Greece and Rome, postliminium
would not exist, because the man who bought a particular slave
would have the right of ownership. Many doctors might lead
us astray in this matter because in discussing the application
ol the law they are thinking of fugitives from justice who
have fled lrom one State to another, and not ol the subjecte, in
a neutral territory, ol one of two belligerent powers.

¹To preserve the directneas ol Gentili’a argumenta and tbe persona} note in thena, it
has seemed wire to summarize hia pleae without comment, to quote his own words,
where it ia possible, and to uae the first person singular. The title ol each chapter ia
given in italica at the head of the summary. Book 11 bar not been analyzed, becatm
it ia devoted almost entirely to questions ol private law.
