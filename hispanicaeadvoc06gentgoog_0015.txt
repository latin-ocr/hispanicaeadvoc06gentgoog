There are two periods in the active life of Alberico Gen-
tili.² Twenty years of it he spent at Oxford‚ teaching
civil law and writing on the Law of Nations. The last
eight years of it he passed mainly tn Lond0n‚ tn the practice
of his profession. Within these eight years the Hispanico Ad-
vocatio falls. The book therefore represents Gentili’s final ⁷
judgment on many weighty matters 11 00011101 the application
to concrete cases of the legal principles which he had been
reaching for a score of years. No other yurist of his time has3
left us this double record, 01 his theory of the law and of his 1

pmwwst.

But 11 11 001 merely the theoretical and the practical methods
followed by Gentili in approaching legal questions which we
find illustrated in this twofold record of his activity as a jurist.
The relation between the two parts is much more intimate. In
the greatest 01 his books, in his treatise On the Low 01 Wor, he
had set down the principles which should govern the conduct
of war. In the Pleas of a kSaenius Ι,1111001010 hc is concerned “ ’
with war again, but this time e is applying the principles which
he had laid down in the earlier work to the actual questions

· arising out of a great war of his own time. During the last '
part of the sixteenth century and the early days of the seventeenth,
Spain and the N etherlands wer'e fighting each other. Out of·
