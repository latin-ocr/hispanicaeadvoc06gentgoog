aoa Introduction

world constituted a single State, and Roman law was drawn up
for the citizens oi this one State. But in the modern world there
are many independent sovereignties, and the Law oi Nations
covers questions at issue between the citizens ol these different
States. To this purpose the civil law, in view oi the circum·
stances in which it grew up, is not adopted. The civil law,
commentators on it and precedente from antiquity are frequently
cited, but rather by way ol confirming or illustrating rules de·
rived from contemporary usage. At the same time Gentili stands
between the ancient and the modern world, and his inheritance
from the ancient world is evident in many ways. It comes out
in the scholastic torm oi his argumentation, which carries us

sionally in a casuistical argument, as it does in the fanciful
distinction which he tries to make in one passage ²⁹ between
the meanings ol certain words, or in the insistence in another

Great as were his aehievements in the field oi international

into marriage cases, into testamentary, ecclesiastieal and maritime cases, and
into others oi this sort, which still have always been held to be the peculiar
province oi those versed in the civil law, but granted that they have pushed
their way in, simply because those cases had to do with Englishmen, with English
concerns, with transactions carried on in England; on this account, pray, shall
they rush in and seiae these cases involving foreigners? Even though this state
oi affairs is in part to be explained by the daily increasing power oi those who
study the common law, still the old landmarks should be preserved.²¹

In one of the two tasks then to which he devoted himself,
he in part failed, I mean in maintaining the supremacy ol the
civil law over the common law in regulating those transactions
in which the civil law seemed to him especially applicable. In
the other he succeeded, ior he set iorth once lor all in his
