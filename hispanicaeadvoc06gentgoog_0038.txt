34a Introduction

we must bear the fact in mind that the Turks are not un·
acquainted with these articles and are not living without them,
as they were three hundred years ago. ,

To mention the fourth point, the Turks are at war with
one another, at the gates of Constantinople and elsewhere, 3ηά
it is more probable that this powder would have been used
against heathen. than against the Christians who are much
farther away from Constantinople. Further‚ the powder 3ηά
iron were a mere makeweight, and were actually used as ballast,
3ηά in reality the English wished to sell it to the Spaniards.
It should be noted also that the evil intent has not been
shown, and that in fact it was lawful to take these things
to the Turks under the Orders in Couneil of Queen Elizabeth.
The Englishman follows the law of his native land, not the
canon or civil law. ’

The fifth point is that the English merchants have made a
manifest of these articles with an official, and under the Orders
in Council of Elizabeth. Now the King of England is a
sovereign prince 3ηά the head of ecclesiastical affairs in his
own domain, 3ηά he can not permit his people to be made
subject to the laws either of the Emperor or the Pontiff.
Under the Law of Nations only a completed act calls for
punishment. Under it the Maltese may interfere with those
who are on their way to sell contraband to an enemy but
may not punish them. The case of the Hanseatic cities is
not parallel, because they were wamed in advance, and were
asked to give up their trade for a time only. The English
would be asked to give up their trade forever, because the
Spaniards 3ηά Turks 333 always at war.

So far as the treaty between England 3ηά Spain goes, it
contemplatos a defensive war, but this is an offensive war
which is being waged against the Turks, 3ηά the mere fact
that the Emperor, who is fighting the Turks, is the relative
and supporter of the King of Spain, does not make the

Spaniards and Turks enemies. Kinship 3ηά private interests
do not determine public policy, and the naming of the
Emperor among the supporters of Spain is an empty form.
Itis said that the Spaniard and the Turk are enemies, because
the lands for which the Emperor and the Turk are fight-
ing are Spanish home-lande, but they are only so by remote
antrcrpatron.
