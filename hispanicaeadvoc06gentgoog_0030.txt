to it, but that the case of a person being conducted through a
church stands on a different basis. Ι assert, however, that it
is not the mere llight to the church, as a place ol refuge, but

our reverence for the sanctity of the church which brings
salety. ¹

In a question involving the immunity oi a church, we
should follow canon law, and canon law makes no distinction
between the case ol the man who flees to a church and that
oi him who is being conducted through a church, and this
theory ot the situation is upheld by usage and by decisions

CHAPTER Vlla-The protectior of scorcrritory.

In this case the Dutch were intercepted by an officer oi ’
the King of Great Britain and made to come to on the high
scas with booty taken lrom Spaniards. The word territory
(as I have shown in my books on war) applies to both land
and water. Scholars state that the Venetians and the Genoese
claim sovereignty and jurisdiction to a point one hundred miles
from their ports, if their shores are not near another State.
The jurisdiction oi the English King is, therefore, immeasur·

territorial power extended to cover these acts ol war between
the Dutch and the Spaniards. They maintain also that they
were intercepted beyond these boundaries. But a treaty of
peace between the British and Spanish Kings requires each
to protect subjecta of the other anywhere within his territories,
and the edict must be interpreted in the light oi the treaty
which is a contract. Otherwise a wrong would be done one
oi the contracting parties, because the peace agreement pro·
vided that each sovereign was to allow no violence to subjecta
oi the other in his territory. The Dutch assert that the edict
merely fixed in permanent form boundaries which had long
been recognized by usage. The King took no account ol
usage in making the treaty. Probably he did not know ol it,
and most certainly the Spanish King did not. Further the
captor was really committing piracy under letters ol marque,
and not carrying on war. This predatory warlare is waged
