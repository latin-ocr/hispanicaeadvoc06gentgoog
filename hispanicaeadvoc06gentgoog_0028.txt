that usages vary from one period to another and from one
place to another.

CHAPTER V.-Whether it t's lawsul to capture the enemy in the
territory of another.

One may pursue a wild beast into a neighbor‘s field or a
fugitive from justice into another's territory, and one may hold
with the ancients that “war is a hunt,’‘ and with the doctors
that “a territory is nothing else than a domain,’' drawing the
conclusion thereirom that a public enemy may be captured
in another's territory. But this conclusion is false. “The
territory oi another insures saiety, and, when territory changes,
control changes.“ Itis commonly held that when a fugitive
flees into a church, he is saie. This privilege is opposed to
the public interest and to the theory oi the common law, but
ir the doctrine holds in the case oi a church, it is still more
applicable when there is a complete change oi territory. It it
holds ior a fugitive from justice, it should surely hold under
the laws oi war. But what shall we say to the principle oi law
which I have laid down in my books On the Low os Wor
that “ anybody and everybody is bound to hand over to the
victor the property and the person oi the vanquished?‘’ I
reply that “this doctrine may be affirmed in the case oi a
complete victory, not in the case oi a small success.‘' “ It may
not be lawiul perse ior the victor to take the spoils, and he
who rules a territory may not always be required to turn them
over to the victor.'’

CHAPTER VL-Wteitrer itis lawsol to conduct on enemy captive .
through onother's territory.

“The Spanish Ambassador opposes the action oi the Dutch
in taking property captured from their Spanish enemies . ., .
through the British sea and along these shores, and he aske the
magistrate here that all the property be stopped and be re·
leased.'‘ Various arguments may be urged in opposition to this
request. For instance, it is lawiul to transport grain through
a place from which it is unlawiul to export it. Some doctors
also hold that ii a criminal is being conducted through the
graveyard oi a church, or even through territory under another
