were concerned¹ in two fundamental points: (ι) Barbary
and Spain were enemies, but Turkey and Venice have treaty
relations. Consequently the Venetians may bring action against
Turkey. (2) In the lormer case the fiscus ol Barbary
interposed only as a matter ol form. My second general
argument is that the Roman laws which have been cited
were applicable to the citizens ol a common State, the Roman
Empire. They can not apply to conditions today when, as in
this case, the litigants are citizens of different States. Thirdly,
piracy must be distinguished from thett. The rule oi the
Law of Nations is that “it is lawlul to buy anything and
from anyone.” “Even wares taken by pirates belong to
unrestricted commerce.” In the fourth place the Venetians
must prove the identity ol their property and the property
which they claim. As a fifth point I note that when the robbers
belong to a foreign nation there is no ground for recovery,
because pirates who are likewise enemies may acquire owner·
ship, and the treaty between Turkey and Venice does not
cover pirates. Finally the trade ot the English with Tunis,
Algeria and many other States is taken from them by.the
Venetian claim that these States are piratical retreats, and that
the people and even the magistrates in them are pirates.

CHAPTER XXIV.-Of inquisitions and the testimony of Turks.

Two direct questions arise in this case: ( 1) When may
torture be used to ascertain the truth, and (2) what weight
should be given to the testimony offered by Turks? Slave
witnesses may not be tortured, il the question is one ol money
only, and if the truth can be ascertained otherwise. Freemen
may be tortured only when they are charged as accomplices,
and give inconsistent evidence. The matter is left to the
discretion of the magistrate. So lar as the second point goes,
the testimony ot Turks is not accepted against Christians.
In addition to the two direct questions just mentioned, two
points are indirectly involved in the case. What is the value
ol testimony given by witnesses under tortore, and how should ,
perjury on their part be treated? What bearing has this
and other evidence on the ownership ol the property in
