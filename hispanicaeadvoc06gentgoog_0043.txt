was by implication excluded. Furthermore, they maintain that
a lessee is not responsible for accidents. There is a clear
precedent against them. A certain prince took a ship for his
own use from his ‚own subjects. The ship was lost, and the
doctors explicitly teach that the prince is under obligation
to return to his subjects what he has taken from them.
Consequently‚ a prince‚ in a similar case, will be under greater
obligation to the subjects of another prince‚ Passing to the
first point in the defense offered by the Tuscans, Ι observe that·
the inclusion in the lease of one chance occurrence, viz., loss
in warfare‚ which was expressly mentioned because most likely
to take place, does not enclude other risks which in ordinary
procedure would have been mentioned. It would be more
natural to regard the clause covering loss in warfare as
superfluous than to suppose that a departure from the law
was contemplated, because a contract under the Law of N ations,
and especially a contract with a prince‚ presupposes good
faith. The second argument put forward by the Tuscans is
worthless. The ship was not leased. It was requisitioned, and
he who took it must make good any accident. Responsibility
for the safety of the ship rested especially on the Tuscans,
because they removed the experienced English sailors and put
their men aboard the vessel.

An English merchant vessel was captured by the Tuscans,
and a Florentine court confiscated iton the ground that it
attacked a Tuscan warship. In placing the responsibility for
a conflict, he is presumed to be the aggressor who is armed,
who is stronger,wh0se profession is one of arms, who comes
off victor, and who has thought himself wronged‚ as the
Tuscans may have done, because of the English trade with
the Turks. The conclusion to be drawn from these considera·
tions is confirmed by the fact that the Tuscans were the
attacking party, that other vessels had undergone a similar
experience‚ and that this incident began with the firing of
two broadsides from the Tuscan man-of-war. The Tuscans
wished to search our vessel, and it may be claimed that
custom uermits such an examination, but the custom is of
