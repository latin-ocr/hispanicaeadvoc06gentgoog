THE CLASSICS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

This series, which includes the classic worlrs connected with the history and develop-
ment ol international law, was undertaken by the Carnegie Institution oi Washington
'in 1906, at the suggestion oi Mr. Jarnes Brown Scott, then Solicitor ior the Departrnent
oi State, under whose supervision as General Editor the series has since been published.
On January 1, 1917, the proiect was transferred to the Carnegie Endowment for inter·
national Peace and the publication oi the series is being continued by the Endowrnent's
Division ol international Law, oi which the General Editor of the Classics is the
Director.

The republication of these classica hasbeen undertaken principally on account oi
the difficulty oi procuring the texts in convenient Iorrn for scientific study. The text ol
each author is reproduced photographically, so as to lay the source beiore the reader
without the mistakes which ereep into a newly printed text. An introduction is prefixed
torach work, giving the necessary biographical details concerning its author and stating
the importance oi the text and its place in internetional law. Tables of errata in the
original are added when necessary, and notes to clear up doubts and ambiguities or to
correct mistahes in the text are supplied. Each oi the Classica is specially edited hy an
ἓκροῗ in intergational law εἴης is larctcompanied by an English version made expressly

or t e serres acom een ransaor.
