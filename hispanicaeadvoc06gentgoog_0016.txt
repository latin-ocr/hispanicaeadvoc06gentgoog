12a Introduction

l this conflict there developed between the Spanish and the Dutch
.a great many difficult questions ol international law, in which
England as a neutral nation was concerned, and, as Gentili’s
brother Scipione remarks m his prelace to the Advocatio, James

these people had referred to him to be settled 1n accordance with Δ
the principles of law and equity.’' The cases at issue were heard
by the English Court of Admiralty, and Alberico Gentili, with
the approval ol King James, represented the interests of Spain

ambassador who had violated the elementary principles of hos·

bravely replied that no other aetion could be taken against
Mendoza than dismissal from England.

have intimated above, Gentili presents the arguments actually
made before the court and arguments made where important
issues were at stake, Dealing as it does largely with decisiom,
precedents and usage, it is conceived more in the spirit of modern
discussions of the subject than any of the other legal writings
