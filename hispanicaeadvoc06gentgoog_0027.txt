Introduction 230

CHAPTER II.-That property does not betonq to the enemy who takes
it until it has been brouqht within his fortified lines.

The property mentioned in the last chapter does not pass
into the ownership of the enemy until it has been brought
within his fortified lines, no matter how long it may be in his
possession. The fleet of the Greeks standing off Troy may have
constituted a fortified line, but a single ship does not, and
there was but one ship in this case. The rule that a capture
is effective only alter the captured property has been brought
within fortified lines is supported by such doctore as Angelus
and Salycetus. In the case before us the Spanish owners have
not even lost possession. They retained it by means of the
Spanish sailors who were leit on board the captured Spanish
vessel. Not only was this property not brought within fortified

lines, but the Spaniards had a fair chance ol escaping.

CHAPTER III.-On the judyment passed by soldiers and on the
varyiny practice in the matter of atinus captured by the enerny.

It is said to be the practice of soldiers “to regard captured
property as theirs, if they have kept it with them for a night.'’
The phrase, “with them,’' probably means within their fortified
lines, so that this military usage is in harmony with the law
which Ι have discussed in the last chapter.

CHAPTER IV.—That property sure to be taken is not held as taken
and acquired by the enemy.

Cephalus holds that “a thing is called capturedwhen it can
not escape capture,” and he applies this dictum to a certain
caseos pirates. Molina applies it to wild beasts which have
been injured by one hunter and ultimately taken by another.
But “to pirates and wild beasts no territory offers safety.'‘
Now this principle is not true in war, of our Spaniards, for
instance, who are saie in neutral territory. If a wild boar
falls into a snare which I have set and you let him go free, he
ceases to be mine. The boar might have been able to free
himself. But whatever the usage in hunting may be, it does
not determine the law ol war. Usage must be established for
the kind oi case under discussion, and we must remember too
